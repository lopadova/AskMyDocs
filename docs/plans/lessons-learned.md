# Canonical Compilation — Lessons Learned

Running log of non-obvious findings, gotchas, and corrections during execution. Every agent must **read this file at the start** and the orchestrator must **append to it** whenever something surprising emerges.

## 2026-04-22 — Baseline assumptions (before Phase 0)

**What we found:** The AskMyDocs codebase on `chore/upgrade-laravel-13` is remarkably clean in terms of Laravel 13 breaking changes — zero application code required modification during the upgrade. The codebase does **not** use `VerifyCsrfToken`, `HasUuids`, `upsert()`, `mergeIfMissing()`, `Schema::getTables()`, custom `Blueprint`/`Grammar`, `boot()` with nested instantiation, `Concurrency::run()`, `Js::from` tests, `'image'` validation, or any pagination-view references. This also means the canonical layer we're adding can use modern Laravel 13 idioms (attribute-based MCP tools, enum casts, readonly DTOs) without competing with legacy code.

**Why it matters:** We can write Phase 1–7 code in the most current style without concerns about mixing paradigms.

**How to handle:** use PHP 8.3+ features (readonly properties, `match`, `#[...]` attributes) freely.

## 2026-04-22 — MarkdownChunker is currently a placeholder

**What we found:** `app/Services/Kb/MarkdownChunker.php` does a naive `preg_split('/\n{2,}/', $md)` — it never populates `heading_path` (always null) and never honors `KB_CHUNK_TARGET_TOKENS` / `KB_CHUNK_HARD_CAP_TOKENS` config. Config keys exist but the service ignores them.

**Why it matters:** Phase 2 already plans to rewrite this file. The rewrite is **a hidden retrieval quality win** for the entire project — even non-canonical docs will get better chunking once Phase 2 ships. Mention this in the PR #11 description as a "side benefit".

**How to handle:** In Phase 2 Task 2.3, make sure the rewritten chunker also covers the non-canonical path (markdown with no frontmatter) — fall back to paragraph split but still populate `heading_path` from headings when present.

## 2026-04-22 — Reranker weights are already config-driven

**What we found:** `app/Services/Kb/Reranker.php` reads `kb.reranking.vector_weight`, `keyword_weight`, `heading_weight` from config — **not hardcoded**. So the plan's "fusion score formula" is actually already configurable today.

**Why it matters:** Phase 3 Task 3.4 (canonical boost/penalty) is purely additive. We don't rewrite the existing fusion — we add a post-fusion adjustment on top. Simpler than expected.

**How to handle:** Keep the existing fusion intact; append canonical-score-adjustment logic AFTER the existing `rerank_score` computation.

---

## 2026-04-22 — Test-mirror migrations use SQLite-compatible types

**What we found:** `tests/database/migrations/` replaces `vector(N)` with `TEXT` (JSON) for SQLite compatibility. Any new migration that uses pgsql-specific types must ship a SQLite-friendly variant in the test mirror.

**Why it matters:** The canonical columns we're adding are all plain types (`string`, `bool`, `smallint`, `json`) that work cleanly on both SQLite and pgsql — no special handling needed. `kb_nodes` / `kb_edges` also use plain types. No divergence expected.

**How to handle:** For Phase 1 migrations, create the test mirrors **identical** to production. Run the full PHPUnit suite after each migration to catch any SQLite edge cases.

---

## 2026-04-22 — Embedding cache is cross-project by design

**What we found:** `embedding_cache` table does NOT have `project_key` — it's a global cache keyed by `(text_hash, provider, model)`. Same text across different projects = one embedding call total.

**Why it matters:** This is an intentional optimization. Don't add `project_key` to `embedding_cache` "for consistency" — it would destroy the cache hit rate. Verified in the `EmbeddingCacheService` code.

**How to handle:** Leave `embedding_cache` alone. New canonical paths (RejectedApproachInjector) can use it too with no modification.

## 2026-04-22 — PHP runtime on dev machine is PHP 8.4 via Herd shim

**What we found:** Dev machine has PHP 8.2 / 8.4 / 8.5 installed via Herd. `php.bat` was remapped to `php84.bat` during the Laravel 13 upgrade. User approved.

**Why it matters:** If Herd auto-regenerates `php.bat` between sessions, future commands might silently use PHP 8.2 which is incompatible with Laravel 13. Agents running tests should verify `php --version` ≥ 8.3 at the start of each session.

**How to handle:** Orchestrator prepends `C:\Users\lopad\.config\herd\bin` to `$env:PATH` in PowerShell at session start. Any command that runs `composer` or `vendor/bin/phpunit` should ensure PHP 8.3+.

## 2026-04-22 — User chose aggressive defaults for graph + rejected

**What we found:** User selected "Entrambi opt-out (attivi di default)" for graph expansion AND rejected-approach injection. Both features ON by default post-upgrade.

**Why it matters:** This is more aggressive than the "opt-in" recommendation. It changes chat retrieval behavior for existing consumers immediately after installing the new version. Mitigation: when there are **zero canonical docs** in the project, both features are **no-ops** (graph is empty, rejected query returns empty collection). So for consumers who haven't canonicalized anything yet, behavior is unchanged.

**How to handle:** Document explicitly in the README and CHANGELOG: "graph expansion + rejected injection are on by default but degrade gracefully to no-op when no canonical docs exist". Provide `KB_GRAPH_EXPANSION_ENABLED=false` escape hatch in `.env.example` with a comment.

---

## 2026-04-22 — Phase 0 agent 0.2 entered plan mode, did no edits (Phase 0, Task 0.2)

**What we found:** When dispatching a `general-purpose` subagent to edit `config/kb.php` + `.env.example`, the subagent unexpectedly entered Plan mode and produced a plan file instead of applying the edits. Same run: agent 0.3 (for ADRs) completed its file writes before plan mode kicked in.

**Why it matters:** For simple deterministic "add N blocks to a file" tasks, dispatching a subagent is actually *slower* and less reliable than doing the edit inline via `Edit` — the subagent may get into plan-mode gating or other meta-behaviors.

**How to handle:** For purely mechanical config/env edits, the orchestrator applies them directly. Reserve subagents for:
- Larger multi-file builds (e.g. "create 5 Tool classes with their tests").
- Research/exploration tasks (Explore agents).
- Reviews (code-reviewer agent).

Future phases: dispatch subagents only when the task genuinely benefits from isolation (multiple files, independent tests, parallelizable work).

## 2026-04-22 — SQLite `dropColumn` fails if the column still has an index (Phase 1, migrations)

**What we found:** The first migration iteration for `knowledge_documents` canonical columns failed on `RefreshDatabase` rollback with:

```
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 error in index knowledge_documents_doc_id_index
after drop column: no such column: "doc_id"
SQL: alter table "knowledge_documents" drop column "doc_id"
```

Laravel 13 Blueprint's `dropColumn` on SQLite does NOT automatically drop per-column indexes created via `->index()`. Composite unique constraints dropped with `dropUnique()` work fine, but plain `->index()` indexes must be dropped explicitly with `dropIndex('<table>_<column>_index')` **before** `dropColumn`.

**Why it matters:** every migration that adds `->index()` on a column on an *existing* table (i.e. `Schema::table`, not `Schema::create`) needs symmetric `dropIndex` calls in `down()`. Missing these breaks rollback and therefore `RefreshDatabase` tests. On pgsql the same down() works fine — only SQLite is affected.

**How to handle:** In every future Phase 1+ migration that touches an existing table and adds a per-column index, include the explicit `dropIndex('<table>_<column>_index')` calls in `down()` before `dropColumn`. Laravel's default index name convention is `<table>_<col>_index` (plain) and `<table>_<col>_unique` (unique).

## 2026-04-22 — commonmark + yaml were already installed transitively (Phase 0, Task 0.1)

**What we found:** `composer update league/commonmark symfony/yaml` said "Nothing to install". Verified via `composer show`: `league/commonmark 2.8.2` (pulled by a Laravel 13 dep) and `symfony/yaml 8.0.8` (pulled by Symfony Console polyfill chain) were already present. Adding them to `require` just promotes them from transitive to direct dependencies — correct behavior for a project that explicitly relies on them.

**Why it matters:** No new packages actually downloaded. `composer.lock` was still regenerated (promotion changes the lock's "packages" section), so we still commit lock changes.

**How to handle:** When adding a dep that's already transitive, don't be surprised by "Nothing to install". Confirm via `composer show <pkg>`. Still commit `composer.json` because the promotion IS a semantic change.

## 2026-04-22 — Skills are templates, not active in this repo

**What we found:** User chose "Solo nel repo AskMyDocs come template" for the 5 Claude skills. They live under `.claude/skills/kb-canonical/` as reference, not as active skills.

**Why it matters:** The skills must NOT have a `description` that would auto-activate them when a developer is working on the AskMyDocs codebase itself. Their trigger text should be explicit about targeting consumer repos.

**How to handle:** In Phase 6, write skill descriptions like "Use this skill WHEN WORKING ON THE CONSUMER KNOWLEDGE BASE (not on AskMyDocs itself)...". Also add a big banner in the skill README clarifying this.
