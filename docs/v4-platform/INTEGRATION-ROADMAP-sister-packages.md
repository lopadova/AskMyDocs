# Sister packages integration roadmap

> **Honest status as of v4.0.2 (2026-05-03)**
>
> Of the five `padosoft/*` sister packages shipped during the v4.0
> cycle, **only `padosoft/laravel-ai-regolo` is wired into AskMyDocs's
> `app/` runtime** today. The other three (`laravel-flow`,
> `eval-harness`, `laravel-pii-redactor`) sit in `composer.json`
> `require-dev` so the dependency train is available, but no
> `use Padosoft\…` import exists in `app/`. Their package repos are v0.1.0
> scaffolds (interfaces, ServiceProviders, foundational tests, partial
> engine code) — production-grade implementations land alongside the
> AskMyDocs integration per the per-package timelines below.
> `padosoft/laravel-patent-box-tracker` is the only sister package not
> declared in AskMyDocs's `composer.json` at all — by design, operators
> install it in their own Laravel project (R37 standalone-agnostic; see
> `tools/patent-box/2026.yml` and the README's Patent Box section).
>
> The v4.0.0 GA release notes and W5/W6/W7 closure docs described these
> packages as "shipped engines"; v4.0.2's docs honesty pass corrects
> the language to reflect the real shipped state without rewriting the
> historical changelog entries.

## Per-package integration plan

The order below is driven by **(a) feature urgency for AskMyDocs consumers**
and **(b) maturity of the upstream package implementation**. The package
side is tracked independently in each repo's enterprise plan
(`docs/ENTERPRISE_PLAN.md` for laravel-flow,
`docs/ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for eval-harness); AskMyDocs adopts
each package version as it stabilizes rather than waiting for v1.0
across the board.

### `padosoft/laravel-ai-regolo` (W2) — STATUS: ✅ Integrated

| Version | Where in `app/` | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| v0.2.x (current) | `app/Ai/Providers/RegoloProvider.php` | The Regolo provider delegates to `laravel/ai` via the standalone package; chat + streaming + embeddings all flow through the SDK abstraction. No further integration work required for v4.x consumers. |

**No integration milestones pending** — v4.0 GA already ships this fully.

---

### `padosoft/laravel-pii-redactor` (W7) — STATUS: 🔴 Scaffold available (v0.1.0 tag, pending Packagist); v4.1 integration target

**Why this lands first** — GDPR exposure on chat persistence is the most
visible production risk among the three pending integrations. AskMyDocs's
`messages` and `chat_logs` tables retain user input verbatim including
free-form text that may contain Italian fiscal identifiers (Codice
Fiscale, Partita IVA), IBAN, credit-card numbers, phone numbers, and
email addresses. The pii-redactor's six checksum-validated detectors
plus the reversible Tokenise strategy let AskMyDocs persist redacted
content for log retention while preserving operator detokenization for
audit trails.

#### v4.1 integration scope

**Touch points in `app/`:**

1. **`app/Http/Middleware/RedactChatPii.php`** — new opt-in middleware
   wrapping `POST /conversations/{id}/messages` and
   `POST /conversations/{id}/messages/stream`. Reads request body,
   runs `Pii::redact()` with the `tokenise` strategy + per-tenant
   namespace (`'tenant-' . tenant_id`), passes the redacted body
   downstream, and persists the original-to-redaction map in a new
   `pii_token_maps` table for operator detokenization.

2. **`app/Services/Kb/EmbeddingCacheService::generate()`** — pre-embedding
   redaction step. Texts containing PII shouldn't be sent to external
   LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini); a new
   `KB_EMBEDDINGS_PII_REDACT=true` config flag invokes
   `Pii::redact($text, 'mask')` before each `generateEmbeddings()`
   call. Mask strategy (not Tokenise) here because embeddings are
   one-way — no detokenization round-trip needed.

3. **`app/Services/Admin/AiInsightsService`** — sample chat snippets
   surfaced in the daily insights snapshot may contain PII. Apply
   `Pii::redact(.., 'mask')` to every snippet before persistence into
   `admin_insights_snapshots.payload_json`.

4. **`app/Models/ChatLog::booted()`** + **`app/Models/Message::booted()`**
   — when `KB_PII_REDACT_PERSIST=true`, hook the `creating` event to
   redact `question`/`answer`/`content` columns before insert. Stores
   the per-row token map as a sibling row under `pii_token_maps`
   (FK ON DELETE CASCADE so retention sweeps stay consistent).

5. **`config/kb.php`** — three new keys: `pii_redactor.enabled`,
   `pii_redactor.strategy` (mask/hash/tokenise/drop default
   tokenise), `pii_redactor.detectors` (allowlist subset of the six;
   default all six on for IT-compliant deployments).

6. **`app/Http/Controllers/Api/Admin/LogViewerController.php`** — extend
   the existing `chat()` / `chatShow()` surface with a new detokenize
   action gated behind `pii.detokenize` Spatie permission; operators
   with the role can view the original PII alongside the redacted
   record (audit trail in `admin_command_audits`).

**Tests required:**

- Feature: chat POST with Codice Fiscale in `content` → `messages.content`
  contains `<CF:abc123>`, `pii_token_maps` row exists with the original
  CF, detokenize endpoint returns the original.
- Feature: embedding cache call with PII text → `EmbeddingCacheService`
  invokes `Pii::redact` BEFORE `generateEmbeddings`; assert the text
  passed to the AI manager is the masked variant.
- E2E: admin chat-log viewer renders redacted body by default; "Show
  original" button (gated by permission) reveals the original.
- Architecture: `RedactChatPii` middleware is registered on
  `auth:sanctum` chat routes only (not admin/insights/maintenance).

**Upstream readiness gates:**

- Pii redactor v0.2 must ship the production-grade detectors (current
  v0.1 is scaffold). AskMyDocs integration starts when v0.2 ships
  (Git tag minimum; Packagist preferred for `composer require` ergonomics).

**Estimated v4.1 effort:** ~2 sub-tasks. Total ~12-16 R36 cycles of work
across the package + AskMyDocs.

---

### `padosoft/laravel-flow` (W5) — STATUS: 🔴 Scaffold available (v0.1.0 tag, pending Packagist); v4.1 integration target

**Why this lands second** — AskMyDocs's ingestion, deletion, and
promotion pipelines are multi-step flows where partial failures
currently leak. `IngestDocumentJob` retries the whole chain on failure
(`$tries = 3` with backoff `[10, 30, 60]`); a real saga with
reverse-order compensation gives proper rollback semantics for partial
writes (file-on-disk + DB rows + graph nodes + embedding cache entries).

#### v4.1 integration scope (uses laravel-flow v0.2 features)

**Touch points in `app/`:**

1. **`app/Jobs/IngestDocumentJob.php`** — replace the implicit retry
   loop with a Flow definition:
   ```php
   Flow::define('kb.ingest')
       ->step('write_file_to_disk')->compensateWith('delete_file')
       ->step('insert_document_row')->compensateWith('soft_delete_document')
       ->step('chunk_and_insert_chunks')->compensateWith('delete_chunks')
       ->step('generate_embeddings')->compensateWith('rollback_embedding_cache_entries')
       ->step('rebuild_canonical_graph_for_doc')->compensateWith('purge_graph_nodes_for_doc')
       ->register();
   ```
   Failure at any step triggers reverse-order compensation. The
   `flow_runs` + `flow_steps` + `flow_audit` tables (laravel-flow v0.2)
   give per-step audit trail without building it in AskMyDocs.

2. **`app/Services/Kb/Canonical/CanonicalWriter`** — promotion pipeline
   becomes a Flow definition with compensation that reverts the canonical
   markdown if `IngestDocumentJob` fails downstream.

3. **`app/Services/Kb/DocumentDeleter::forceDelete()`** — hard delete is
   currently a sequence (kb_nodes cascade → soft → wait retention →
   hard → file remove). A Flow definition makes the partial-failure
   recovery explicit (e.g., DB hard delete succeeds but file removal
   fails — compensation stages a retry queue entry).

4. **`app/Console/Commands/PruneDeletedDocumentsCommand`** — bulk prune
   wrapped in a Flow with `--dry-run` mapping to laravel-flow's native
   dry-run mode (no DB writes, audit-only).

5. **`config/kb.php`** — `flow.enabled`, `flow.persistence_enabled`
   (off by default — keeps in-memory v0.1 path for SQLite tests),
   `flow.queue` (default `default`).

6. **Database migrations** — publish laravel-flow's `flow_runs` /
   `flow_steps` / `flow_audit` migrations (v0.2 ships them). They
   land alongside AskMyDocs's existing migration set, gated by
   `flow.persistence_enabled`.

**Tests required:**

- Feature: ingest a doc that fails on `generate_embeddings` step —
  assert file removed + document soft-deleted + chunks deleted +
  cache entries rolled back, all via the Flow's compensation chain.
- Feature: `kb:replay <run-id>` (laravel-flow v0.2 CLI) on a failed
  ingestion — assert the new linked run completes successfully and
  the original failed run is preserved.
- E2E: admin maintenance page surfaces failed Flow runs from
  `flow_runs` (read-only — execution remains via Artisan / API).
- Architecture: every multi-step service that does file writes +
  DB writes must be expressible as a Flow definition (gradual
  migration — gate via a code-level annotation or selective
  enforcement).

**Upstream readiness gates:**

- laravel-flow v0.2 ships persistence layer + queue support
  (Macro Tasks 2 + 3 in the package's enterprise plan). AskMyDocs
  integration depends on v0.2 stabilization.
- v0.3 (approval gates + webhooks) is NOT required for v4.1 — those
  features support different use cases (human-in-the-loop workflows
  outside of the kb ingestion path). v4.2 candidate for promotion
  workflow approval gates.

**Estimated v4.1 effort:** ~4 sub-tasks (one per flow conversion +
config + migration). Total ~20-25 R36 cycles.

### `padosoft/eval-harness` (W6) — STATUS: 🔴 Scaffold available (v0.1.0 tag, pending Packagist); v4.1 integration target

**Why this lands third** — AskMyDocs has zero RAG retrieval
regression coverage today. Any prompt change, reranker tweak, or
embedding model swap can silently degrade answer quality. The
eval-harness gives a CI-gated regression suite without building
RAG-specific evaluation infrastructure.

#### v4.1 integration scope (uses eval-harness v0.2 features)

**Touch points in `app/` + new directories:**

1. **`tests/Eval/datasets/canonical-rag-golden.yml`** — golden Q&A
   dataset for canonical KB queries. Each sample defines:
   - Input query (e.g., "What's the canonical decision on cache
     invalidation?")
   - Expected answer text (or substring match)
   - Expected citations (specific `doc_id` or slug)
   - Tags: `canonical`, `decision-doc`, etc. (cohort grouping)

2. **`tests/Eval/datasets/non-canonical-rag-baseline.yml`** — same
   shape, queries against the non-canonical KB to baseline the
   canonical boost.

3. **`tests/Eval/Metrics/CitationRetrievalMetric.php`** — custom
   metric (extends eval-harness's `Metric` interface) asserting that
   the response cites the expected `doc_id` set. Uses cohort
   grouping by `metadata.tags` (eval-harness v0.2) to surface
   per-document-type retrieval quality separately.

4. **`app/Console/Commands/EvalRagCommand.php`** — wraps
   `eval-harness:run tests/Eval/datasets/canonical-rag-golden.yml`
   with AskMyDocs-specific defaults: `--registrar=AskMyDocs\Eval\AskMyDocsRegistrar`,
   `--metrics=ExactMatch,CosineEmbedding,CitationRetrievalMetric`,
   output to `storage/eval-reports/`.

5. **`.github/workflows/eval.yml`** — new CI job that runs
   `php artisan eval:rag --json --out=eval-report.json` on every
   PR touching `app/Services/Kb/`, `resources/views/prompts/`, or
   `config/ai.php`. Non-blocking initially (status check posts
   results as PR comment); becomes blocking after baseline
   stabilization.

6. **`config/eval.php`** — `eval.providers.judge` (the LLM provider
   used by `LlmAsJudgeMetric`), `eval.cost_budget_eur` (cap on
   per-run LLM spend for live evals), `eval.adversarial_enabled`
   (opt-in flag for v4.2 adversarial datasets per eval-harness v0.3).

**Tests required:**

- The eval suite IS the test — `eval:rag` exit code 0 on green
  baseline, non-zero on regression.
- Add a `tests/Eval/EvalCommandTest.php` (PHPUnit) that asserts
  `eval:rag` runs against the deterministic test dataset without
  hitting external LLMs (uses `LlmAsJudgeMetric` in stub mode).

**Upstream readiness gates:**

- eval-harness v0.2 ships parallel batch queues + Horizon-ready
  execution (Macro Task 3 in the package's roadmap). AskMyDocs
  integration starts when v0.2 ships (Git tag minimum).
- v0.3 adversarial harness (prompt injection, jailbreak, PII leak
  red-teaming) is a v4.2 candidate — at that point AskMyDocs adds
  `eval:adversarial` to the CI matrix as a separate non-blocking
  gate.

**Estimated v4.1 effort:** ~3 sub-tasks (golden dataset + custom
metric + Artisan command + CI workflow). Total ~10-15 R36 cycles.

---

### `padosoft/laravel-patent-box-tracker` (W4) — STATUS: ✅ External runner by design

**No AskMyDocs `app/` integration is planned, ever.** The standalone-agnostic
architecture rule (R37 in `CLAUDE.md`) requires that AskMyDocs USES the
packages but never hard-depends on the tracker — installing AskMyDocs
should not pull in a Patent Box dossier generator that's only relevant
to Italian operators in the `documentazione_idonea` regime.

The dogfood pattern stays exactly as today:

1. AskMyDocs ships `tools/patent-box/2026.yml` — the dossier config
   template (placeholder values for P.IVA, repo paths, SIAE/UIBM IDs).
2. Operators install `padosoft/laravel-patent-box-tracker` in a
   **separate Laravel project** they control.
3. They run `php artisan patent-box:cross-repo
   /abs/path/to/AskMyDocs/tools/patent-box/2026.yml` against their
   local clones of AskMyDocs + the four sister packages.
4. The tracker emits the audit-grade PDF + JSON dossier suitable
   for filing.

**No version of v4.x changes this contract.** If a future v5+ pivots
to bundling the tracker, that requires an ADR overriding the
standalone-agnostic rule, with explicit rationale for why the
operator-managed external pattern is no longer sufficient.

---

## Per-version delivery plan

| AskMyDocs version | Target date | Sister packages integration deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| **v4.0.x** (current train) | ongoing | Patch-level fixes only (composer constraints, docs, latent bugs surfaced by Copilot review). No new sister-package integration. |
| **v4.1.0** | TBD — gated on package readiness | All three pending integrations land in a single major: pii-redactor middleware + chat persistence redaction (v0.2 of the package); laravel-flow saga conversion of `IngestDocumentJob` + canonical promotion + bulk delete (v0.2 of the package); eval-harness golden dataset + RAG regression CI (v0.2 of the package). Each integration is a sub-task on `feature/v4.1` per R37; once-per-major merge to main when all three close. |
| **v4.2.0** | TBD — eval-harness v0.3 + flow v0.3 dependent | adversarial regression suite via `eval:adversarial`; promotion-pipeline approval gates via flow v0.3 ApprovalGate (KbPromotionController POST `/promote` becomes a flow with optional human-approval pause for high-impact canonical writes). |

## Ordering rationale

1. **pii-redactor first** — single largest production risk surface
   (GDPR/PII exposure on chat retention). Smallest implementation
   surface (one middleware + one config + token-map table). Lowest
   blast radius if rolled back (opt-in flag).
2. **laravel-flow second** — improves robustness of an existing
   working subsystem (ingestion). No user-visible behaviour change
   on the happy path; failure path becomes recoverable. Bigger
   surface (touches 3 services + 1 command).
3. **eval-harness third** — quality / regression guardrail.
   Doesn't change runtime behaviour; ships as CI infrastructure.
   Last because it benefits most from the prior two integrations
   being stable (so the regression baseline reflects the production
   pipeline, not in-flight changes).

## Out of scope for v4.x

- **Migration helpers from spatie/laravel-workflow / Symfony Workflow
  to laravel-flow** — laravel-flow ships these in its v1.0 (Macro
  Task 6); AskMyDocs has no historical workflow library to migrate
  from, so this is just consumed for free when the package matures.
- **Companion dashboard for laravel-flow / eval-harness** — both
  packages ship companion dashboard apps in their v1.0 (Macro Task 5
  in laravel-flow, Macro Task 6 report API + separate UI package in
  eval-harness). AskMyDocs's existing admin SPA may surface the
  read-only views via the report APIs in v4.2+, but won't bundle
  the dashboard apps.

## How to extend this roadmap

- **When a sister package ships a new version**: confirm the new
  capabilities, decide which AskMyDocs subsystem benefits, add the
  integration scope under the package's section, and bump the
  per-version table.
- **When integrating**: open a sub-branch off the relevant
  `feature/v4.x` integration branch (R37). One sub-task per
  integration touch point. R36 loop on each PR. Once all sub-tasks
  for a version close, merge `feature/v4.x` → main and tag the
  AskMyDocs version per R39.
- **When skipping**: if a sister package doesn't make sense to
  integrate at all, document the deliberate skip here (analogous to
  the patent-box-tracker external-by-design entry).
